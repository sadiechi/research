## Aug 26 class reflection:
Today we did an inclass activity as a group using teamwork to compare the waterfall model to the agile model. In this lesson and previous lessons I understood that using a waterfall model is where an approach to a software developement project is done in linear steps, where there is a clear end goal. Waterfall model is still one of the most common approaches in developers, with a very logicial progression where each step must be completed before moving to the next. 

In the last Thursday sesion, we worked as a team with marshmallows to build the tallest tower. This can be linked to the concept of agile software development, where collaboration in a tean is essential to evolve and develop solutions to problems. Agile appeared to be more similar to a dot plot, where it has uncertainty but has success through smaller increments. 

The main goal was to understand what MVP was - this is the Minimum Viable Product in agile. It requires working from the top down, recognising users/consumers etc. 

## Code I'm inspired by:

A lot of my inspiration would probably come from youtubers I watch, specifically [Dream](https://youtube.com/c/dream)
In his videos, Dream uses plugins coded by him and his friends for minecraft challenge videos! I would say his videos would be a main source of inspiration for me as I love the creativity involved in coming up with the ideas, and seeing it excecuted in a really entertaining way through a video format is a great way to inspire other people interested in code too. I like this video in particular: [Minecraft Death Swap 2](https://youtu.be/KjRfXURKAx8)
I find the coding in this video to be particularly inspiring, as they have used a simple concept of using (presumably java code) to swap places with each other every five minutes, while making it an entertaining video idea as a fight to the death - who ever kills the other first wins. 

More code I found inspiring, more within my skill level (I think) is this python calculator I found on GitHub:
[Calculator](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/calculator.py).
I think this is probably a good area to start in with more traditional coding, especially for a beginner..
