## Aug 26 class reflection:
Today we did an inclass activity as a group using teamwork to compare the waterfall model to the agile model. In this lesson and previous lessons I understood that using a waterfall model is where an approach to a software developement project is done in linear steps, where there is a clear end goal. Waterfall model is still one of the most common approaches in developers, with a very logicial progression where each step must be completed before moving to the next. 

In the last Thursday sesion, we worked as a team with marshmallows to build the tallest tower. This can be linked to the concept of agile software development, where collaboration in a tean is essential to evolve and develop solutions to problems. Agile appeared to be more similar to a dot plot, where it has uncertainty but has success through smaller increments. 

The main goal was to understand what MVP was - this is the Minimum Viable Product in agile. It requires working from the top down, recognising users/consumers etc.
