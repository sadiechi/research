# Inspiration I Found (+ comments on my own code / project ideas) 

## Inspiration

A lot of my inspiration would probably come from youtubers I watch, specifically [Dream](https://youtube.com/c/dream)
In his videos, Dream uses plugins coded by him and his friends for minecraft challenge videos! I would say his videos would be a main source of inspiration for me as I love the creativity involved in coming up with the ideas, and seeing it excecuted in a really entertaining way through a video format is a great way to inspire other people interested in code too. I like this video in particular: [Minecraft Death Swap 2](https://youtu.be/KjRfXURKAx8)

I find the coding in this video to be particularly inspiring, as they have used a simple concept of using (presumably java code) to swap places with each other every five minutes, while making it an entertaining video idea as a fight to the death - who ever kills the other player first wins. This is a fun idea as the player has to come up with scenarios that could kill the other when the swap is initiated. 

More code I found inspiring, or more within my skill level (I think) is this python calculator I found on GitHub:
[Calculator](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/calculator.py).
I think this is probably a good area to start in with more traditional coding, especially for a beginner..
I found in line 112 some code techniques taught in one of the earlier lectures:

```python
print("\nScientific Calculator\n\nFor Example: sin(rad(90)) + 50% * (sqrt(16)) + round(1.42^2)"
        + "- 12mod3\n\nEnter quit to exit")

    if sys.version_info.major >= 3:
        while True:
            k = input("\nWhat is ")
            if k == "quit":
                break
            result(k)

    else:
        while True:
            k = raw_input("\nWhat is ")
            if k == "quit":
                break
            result(k)
```
           
I'm able to identify techniques we learnt earlier, simple ones like print, if, else and elif.
Some of these I was able to use in coding a couple weeks ago, which I uploaded to my repository (I think this was the dog years calculator)

## My code (Scratch and dog years calculator)

I uploaded two very small code I made based on some of the lessons tasks, I can't check if they actually uploaded properly because I work on a mac so hopefully it did. I found my scratch project super fun to make, it was really easy way to make an almost video game. This felt quite creative and fun to me as I got to redraw the sprite and background. The dog years calculator was also interesting to make as it was a more traditional way to code, and the first time I tried coding. I did attempt the other coding tasks but I chose to leave it for when Roman was in class because alot of us got stuck haha.

## Recent class ideas

During class I was shown techniques to apply music to coding which sounds really cool to me! I think this could be a really good idea especially for me as I'm quite a perfectionist, and coding with music feels quite uncertain and unknown to me. But this also could be a good idea for my upcoming project because it is not completely unfamiliar as I've grown up around music, so maybe I could incorporate my violin playing into this too. Other than this idea, I would love to take inspiration from indie video games in my project somehow.

# A Few Afterclass Reflections

## 18 Aug class reflection:

Today we made a video graph as a class, I think this is a more important class to reflect on because it wasn't a traditional lecture. As a class we were given instruction to create a video chain and then play this at the end. 
Reflective questions: How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego? How are we evolving with this device? How could we draw this activity? Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?

This lesson was based around relational aesthetics, from what I understand this is where art is based or inspired from human relations, or where the concept of the audience and the performer is blurred. In our lesson, we created a form (?) of acyclic graph. This is a type of graph that has no directed cycles. So the graph is still connected by vertices but does not necessarily complete a full loop.
I thought this was a really interesting lesson and way to learn this concept as a class, although referring to the questions above I can be pretty camera shy so I probably wasn't the best for this activity haha..
We could definitely draw this activity, as it wouldn't be a closed loop in my opinion with the amount of videos made.

## Aug 26 class reflection:

Today we did an inclass activity as a group using teamwork to compare the waterfall model to the agile model. In this lesson and previous lessons I understood that using a waterfall model is where an approach to a software developement project is done in linear steps, where there is a clear end goal. Waterfall model is still one of the most common approaches in developers, with a very logicial progression where each step must be completed before moving to the next. 

In the last Thursday sesion, we worked as a team with marshmallows to build the tallest tower. This can be linked to the concept of agile software development, where collaboration in a tean is essential to evolve and develop solutions to problems. Agile appeared to be more similar to a dot plot, where it has uncertainty but has success through smaller increments. 

The main goal was to understand what MVP was - this is the Minimum Viable Product in agile. It requires working from the top down, recognising users/consumers etc.
