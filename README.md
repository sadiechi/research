## Inspiration I Found (+ comments on my own code / project ideas) 

---

### Inspiration

A lot of my inspiration would probably come from youtubers I watch, specifically [Dream](https://youtube.com/c/dream).
In his videos, Dream uses plugins coded by him and his friends for minecraft challenge videos! I would say his videos would be a main source of inspiration for me as I love the creativity involved in coming up with the ideas, and seeing it excecuted in a really entertaining way through a video format is a great way to inspire other people interested in code too. I like this video in particular: [Minecraft Death Swap 2](https://youtu.be/KjRfXURKAx8)

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=KjRfXURKAx8

I find the coding in this video to be particularly inspiring, as they have used a simple concept of using (*presumably java code*) to swap places with each other every five minutes, while making it an entertaining video idea as a fight to the death - who ever kills the other player first wins. This is a fun idea as the player has to come up with scenarios that could kill the other when the swap is initiated. I wanted to include their videos in my repository as they have literally made coding into their career, but in a creative and inspiring way which I think is really cool :)

More code I found inspiring, or more within my skill level (*I think*) is this python calculator I found on GitHub:
[Calculator](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/calculator.py).
I think this is probably a good area to start in with more traditional coding, especially for a beginner..
I found in line 112 some code techniques taught in one of the earlier lectures:

```python
print("\nScientific Calculator\n\nFor Example: sin(rad(90)) + 50% * (sqrt(16)) + round(1.42^2)"
        + "- 12mod3\n\nEnter quit to exit")

    if sys.version_info.major >= 3:
        while True:
            k = input("\nWhat is ")
            if k == "quit":
                break
            result(k)

    else:
        while True:
            k = raw_input("\nWhat is ")
            if k == "quit":
                break
            result(k)
```
           
I'm able to identify techniques we learnt earlier, simple ones like **print**, **if**, **else** and **elif**.
Some of these I was able to use in coding a couple weeks ago, which I uploaded to my repository (**I think this was the dog years calculator**)

### My code (Scratch and dog years calculator)

I uploaded two very small code I made based on some of the lessons tasks, I can't check if they actually uploaded properly because I work on a mac so hopefully it did. I found my scratch project super fun to make, it was a really easy way to make an almost video game. This felt quite creative and fun to me as I got to redraw the sprite and background. The dog years calculator was also interesting to make as it was a more traditional way to code, and also the first time I tried coding. I did attempt the other coding tasks but I chose to leave it for when Roman was in class because alot of us got stuck haha.

### Recent class ideas

During class I was shown techniques to apply music to coding which sounds really cool to me! I think this could be a really good idea especially for me as I'm quite a perfectionist, and coding with music feels quite uncertain and unknown to me. This would be a good thing to put me out of my comfort zone and try something new, and to learn the uncertainty around coding. This also could be a good idea for my upcoming project because it is not completely unfamiliar as I've grown up around music, so maybe I could incorporate my violin playing into this too. Other than this idea, I would love to take inspiration from indie video games in my project, maybe even a Scratch one but I would like a bit of a challenge to be honest.

## A Few Afterclass Reflections

---

### 18 Aug class reflection:

Today we made a video graph as a class, I think this is a more important class to reflect on because it wasn't a traditional lecture. As a class we were given instruction to create a video chain and then play this at the end. 
**Reflective questions: How did you feel as a subject of a video? Did you notice your ego? How are we evolving with this device? How could we draw this activity? Did you feel more attachment to the phone than to your image?**

This lesson was based around relational aesthetics, from what I understand this is where art is based or inspired from human relations, or where the concept of the audience and the performer is blurred. In our lesson, we created a form (?) of acyclic graph. This is a type of graph that has no directed cycles. So the graph is still connected by vertices but does not necessarily complete a full loop.
I thought this was a really interesting lesson and way to learn this concept as a class, although referring to the questions above I can be pretty camera shy so I probably wasn't the best for this activity haha..
We could definitely draw this activity, as it wouldn't be a closed loop in my opinion with the amount of videos made.

### Aug 26 class reflection:

Today we did an inclass activity as a group using teamwork to compare the waterfall model to the agile model. In this lesson and previous lessons I understood that using a waterfall model is where an approach to a software developement project is done in linear steps, where there is a clear end goal. Waterfall model is still one of the most common approaches in developers, with a very logicial progression where each step must be completed before moving to the next. 

In the last Thursday sesion, we worked as a team with marshmallows to build the tallest tower. This can be linked to the concept of agile software development, where collaboration in a team is essential to evolve and develop solutions to problems. Agile appeared to be more similar to a dot plot, where it has uncertainty but has success through smaller increments. 

The main goal was to understand what MVP was - this is the **Minimum Viable Product** in agile. It requires working from the top down, recognising users/consumers etc.

## Reflective Prompts

---

#### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?

I feel like I subconciously take breaks from my screen through music, either through practising violin or singing along to random music haha. I should probably try to knowingly take breaks more regularly though.  

#### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

I have never heard of timeboxing, but it is a form of time management where fixed time is allocated to an activity. I don't think I could use this as I feel like my energy or motivation is quite random, so keeping to a tight or specific schedule would feel overwhelming.

#### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

4, I am pretty confident in this assignment but not so confident for the next assignment - most likely because I'm known to be a high achiever even if I don't really need to be.

#### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?

I'm proud of getting code to function, its small but still motivating.

#### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 

Not sure if this is really a strategy, but usually reviewing after a lecture or quickly skimming notes maybe a few days after helps to reinforce what I learnt. I think this is probably quite a lazy technique, but honestly has never failed me. Consistent and small ish amounts of effort, through reviewing or practice here and there builds up overtime and helps your memory. Another more contrasting technique could be a blurt technique, which is a bit more time consuming. This where I would hear a topic and write down everything I knew or was recently taught about the subject. This is probably more useful for subjects like biology with large amounts of content, but it is definitely way more time consuming.

#### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?

Check your assesment times, and ask more questions. 

#### What is Python?

Python is a type of computer programming language that we are aiming to learn a bit of in this course. This is a general-purpose language, meaning it is not specialised for any specific problem. 

#### Have you meditated before?

I have in highschool in our Religious Education classes, but outside of this no. So it would be nice to do meditation without such a focus on religion.

#### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?

I've gained a really high degree of mastery in violin, I have payed since I was 4 years old. So I guess achieving that mastery took pretty much my whole life haha,, I only really started getting into fully mastering violin at around 12 years old so I know that it takes alot of motivation, dedication and long hours of practice.

#### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?

I think kind of, a very beginner developer with big ideas. 

#### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?

I value creativity alot, especially since majority of my family are involved in the arts. (my parents work in the film industry). I would also say I am a very creative person, I love music and drawing so I value creativity alot. In highschool I took two math subjects and 3 sciences, so I took very technical/ typically logical subjects, so I really believe that creativity is the key to learning to think logically, and achieving a high level in these type of subjects.

#### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

Around 70, 20-30 are study related. 

#### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?

Yup, it's very frustrating. I thought the best idea was to just take a break. I do the same when I practice violin, when I come back even just 10 mins later I sound alot better. 

#### What is an IDE?

IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, this is an application used specifically for computer programmers to develop software. 

#### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?

I learnt that I should probably try to value teamwork more. More specifically I guess is that simple is better, and to not overthink it atleast on the first attempt. 

#### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?

In our group, there were multiple ideas that were clashing or too complicated for the challenge. We overcame them by thinking more simply, but it did take us to the final try haha.

#### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?

Coming up with or making ideas for my project, I'm very indecisive but I also want to be happy with my work so I don't want to do something too simple, but also not something too complicated. 

#### What is OOP?

Object-oriented Programming
This is a style of programming where the design is oriented around logical objects/data (objects contain data), therefore programmers can focus on the objects they want to manipulate, not how to manipulate them. This means python is designed for OOP. 

#### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious? 

I think the announcements are really useful to keep me on track for upcoming classes. 

#### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?

I like to push the limits of what I can do, so when trying out those coding tasks I really wanted to go further and do the others but wasn't really able to (or encouraged to) as we hadn't reached that point in the course yet. 

#### What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism in programming is the supplying of a single interface, e.g. a class that extends to another potentially different entity. Polymorphism appears to be very important in OOP, as it allows a single interface to have multiple implementations. 

#### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

I think I usually do when learning, usually my critial voice is quite a perfectionist and doesn't let me make mistakes. This voice makes it hard to even give things ago, because I'm scared of making mistakes. I overcame this and gave things a go, an even if I made 'mistakes' everything was okay, because making mistakes has to be apart of the learning process. It's more overcoming this fear which is the hard part for me. 

#### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?

I guess what I said above, overcoming my fear of making mistakes, and actually giving coding a go. I solved this by trusting myself, and became more comfortable with this process after messing around a bit within the programs. 

#### What is pair programming?

This is an agile programming technique where two programmers work together at a single computer. One writes the code and the other reviews it as its being written. 

#### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?

I'm looking forward to applying programming to our projects, or learning the whole process that comes with codinga small project like this or similar.

#### What is conscious listening?

Concious listening is where we aim to be intentionally present in a conversation or in a class setting. Being a concious listener will most likely help to retain knowledge taught, as we would be knowingly internalising what we are listening to and aknowledging it. (Instead of just letting information wash over and not truly sink in.)

#### What is a variable?

A variable is something that can be changed, or replaced. It can be defined as something e.g. 'x'. In programming, they are used in the same way where they store information that can be changed according to the program. 

#### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?

Probably Java, no partciular reason I don't know much about it only that Minecraft uses it hahah. But I'm open to other languages, and creative ones look especially fun. 

#### What is something kind that someone has done for you?

When my dad drives me to classes or orchestra sometimes during the week.

#### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

Programming tells a computer exactly what to do and how to work. 

#### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?

Maybe seeing other classmates assesmentswork, I think it was helpful to know what others are doing but seeing how some people in the class had alot more experience definitely made me feel a little doubtful of my ability (but not overwhelmingly). 

#### What is a fixed mindset?

In a fixed mindset, people believe that their qualities e.g. intelligence are fixed or talents are inherent, and therefore cannot grow. I always thought this is a very close minded and limited mindset, as it pretty much stops you from growing and developing your qualities. For example, when people say I'm a very talented muscician and they could never be a violinist like me, it is not true at all and almost undermines the hardwork I put in (as it implies talent is inherent, and I was just born with musicality which isn't true...) As well as the fact any one can develop those skills, and shouldn't limit themselves, even if development might come a little slower.

#### What is something kind you have done for someone else?

I had my first orchestra rehearsal this week, I arrived a bit early so I helped set up all the chairs.

#### Have you developed a habit of persevering?

I think I definitely have, but probably more from taking calculus where it is super overwhelming to learn, but it teaches you to learn the fun and beauty you can see in mathematics. I think this also can be applied to coding/this course, where it can seem intense at first or unfamiliar, but becomes easier as you begin to learn the ins and outs.
